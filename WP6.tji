          It will not be possible to do it before the pilot survey starts (due in October 2020).
          Instead of this preliminary field investigation, we agreed, in an internal meeting
          that we will rely mostly on the expertise of our collaborators of NAERLS and NVRI,
          who have a deep knowledge of the local socio-economic and epidemiological context
          of the pilot survey zone to build the pilot survey protocol.
